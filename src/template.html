                Schmengo’s was established in 2016, with one clear goal in mind: 
                offering serviceable food that our customers will likely forget, 
                but keep coming back for.

                Sometimes you aren’t in the mood to go to a premium restaurant. 
                Maybe it’s been a tiring week, and you just want to sit down and enjoy 
                some average food from an average establishment. <strong>We understand.</strong></div>

                Schmengo Schmengus came from humble beginnings as an aspiring businessman. 
                As a matter of fact, Schmengo’s was just one of many business ventures, all of 
                which failed prior. Through a moderate amount of effort, he found success with 
                his first venture into the food industry.

                Schmengo never had a strong passion for the culinary arts, but he’s 
                always had a strong passion for making enough money to live comfortably. 
                We’re confident you will see that during your time at Schmengo’s.
